            <h2 class="subtitle is-size-4">A new, very efficient algorithm enables fast scene rendering</h2>
            <p class="is-size-5">Ray-tracing is a technique for scene rendering in which the light rays that fall into an observer's eyes are retraced, so to say, 
                in the reverse direction, to reconstruct exactly what the view would have been. This is a daunting process, because when encoutering 
                solid bodies, light is scattered, and so the ray tracing must chase the many possible backwards paths of such scattering. Professor 
                de Alfaro recently claimed to have invented a new, far more efficient algorithm, one that works in microseconds regardless of the dimension 
                or complexity of the scene. "There are a few restrictions," he added, "and for the moment our new technique is applicable only to closed environments 
                in which the integral of the luminous flux is zero across any closed surface." The contribution is currently undergoing peer review.
