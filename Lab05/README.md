1. The timing experiment in sort.c went ok for me. The  SelectionSort() went much better for me and I was able to finish faster than 
 InsertionSort(). The Insert wasn't what I expected because when working on it, it took me time to understand the process. The selectionsort 
 was much better because I was able to get help from the lab section. 
 2. This lab is basically creating lists with pointers. We needed to make functions for adding to a list, removing an element, sorting it, and more. I thought
 the most important parts of the lab was making the functions and having their respected tests for each to see if each works. I had enjoyed alot of spending time
 with each function and getting to understand how its created and works
 3. I approached the lab not reading the manual first, but instead going to a section where I could ask questions and get a better understanding from them.
 I eventually spent more time on the lab manual and got more understanding of it. The Create functions had a couple of problems for me and I eventually found out 
 what went wrong and how I could fix it. The first few function worked well because I followed the manual and was able to much better after. I would have started this lab 
 earlier because I was rushing all of it at the end and it hurt me because I have a lot of other work to do. Other students helped by answering questions about errors
 and common issues we were having. 
 4. Finally I was able to finish everything besides the last InsertionSort. I spent more than 6 hours on the lab and most of was on the functions and tests. I liked that 
 the lab taught us more about pointers, but I didn't like the certain problems I was having that caused me to have excessive work. The lab was worthwhile, but wish it was 
 extended one more day because I wasn't able to get help on friday. Point distribution was fair and did not have any problems. The discussion and teachings helped me a lot in 
 class.
