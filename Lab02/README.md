-What happens if the line “scanf(" ");” executes?  Why?
Scanf is asked to convert any input applied to it, from the function it it running. The reason is because 
it reads the input such as the keyboards. 
-In this lab, we forbid you from using printf() or scanf() inside
of certain functions.  Explain why a rule like this is useful.
I believe we are forbidden because of organization. I think it's to keep it more organized. 
-How long did this lab take you?  Was it harder or easier than you
expected?
This lab took me a couple of hours. It wasn't easier or harder than expected, but was perfectly fine.
