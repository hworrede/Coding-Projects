2. In this we learned how to make a programmed game called crawler role. I was able to use my past knowledge on using keyboard to help me understand this 
project. We used keyboard to read user input and display it eventually on terminal. The Game.c file and player.c file both were used to help the game. The Main
consisted of what it all came up to. The most important parts were going through all the directions. The game.c file took me time to fix, 
but eventually worked fine. 
3. I approached the lab not reading the manual first, but instead going to a section where I could ask questions and get a better understanding from them.
 I eventually spent more time on the lab manual and got more understanding of it. The game.c file had many problems for me because I wasn't able to get to work 
 correctly, and tried all the other solutions to debug it and fix it. The first few function worked well because I followed the manual and was able to much better after.
 I would have started this lab earlier because I was rushing most that I could towards the end.It hurt a little because I have a lot of other work to do. Other students 
 helped by answering questions about errorsand common issues we were having. 
4. Finally I was able to finish everything. I spent more than 6 hours on the lab and most of was on the functions and debugging. I liked that 
 the lab taught us more about the how to make a game with two files and main. Each file has its own purpose. Some parts were a bit confusing 
 but I didn't like the certain problems I was having that caused me to have excessive work. The lab was worthwhile, but took me longer than expected and 
 spent more time on the debugging of it. Point distribution was fair and did not have any problems. The discussion and teachings helped me a lot in class.
