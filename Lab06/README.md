1. In this lab we learned how to manipulate the controllers, and switches. We spent time using 
the microcontrollers. Each part was different but used a similar technique. We learned about timers 
We also used the potentiometer, switches, buttons, and LEDS to get a better grasp of the lab. 
2. My approach to this lab was to understand more about microcontrollers and learning how to use to correct
C code to interrupt the assignment. I read the lab manual first and spent a significant amount of time researching
the correct way of learning about IO. The set up went extremely wrong because I didn't have the right networks. 
I would've spent more time on this lab and asked more questions from my TA's for help. The class was helpful, but 
I didn't get enough information I needed. 
3. It ended fine but I couldn't get my buttons to work because of the amount of erros I was having. I spent over 13 hours 
on this lab and spent a lot time trying to fix errors and mistakes. The lab was worthwhile and I think I could've spent more 
quality time on it to get the best work. The hardest parts were part 4 because the Test would not work for some reason and became 
a huge problem eventually because the debounce was acting strange. Some examples from the lectures helped but I should've spent more 
time on it so wouldn't have to worry about it.
