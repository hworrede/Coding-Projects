2. The lab was interesting and partly harsh. Creating the stack function were hard to understand at first until I started to understand it
and was able to make quick progress. I think the most important part of the lab was doing the rpn functions because that took more thought 
and I was able to get a better understanding of each function. It took a awhile when debugging and finding  the errors but it eventually made sense. 
3. My general approach was trying different ways of using stack and eventually getting help from TA's for better understanding. I read the lab manual
first and then continued on after. I had a couple of errors when making my rpn evaluate and I also had trouble trying to create my backspace. If I were 
to do it again I would try my best to understand the basic rules. Getting other help from classmates were helpful for just clarifying questions and knowing 
what the TA has told us. 
4. The lab ended up mostly done except the backspace function. I spent over 10 hours on this lab and I only liked when I was able to get certain errors correct. I
also enjoyed figuring out the rpn evaluate system. I disliked the amount time that was needed because I was rushed with other projects and homework assignments
and was having trouble trying to understand it. Yea I think this lab was worthwhile. A suggestion is to add more time for the project and maybe give simple error 
mistakes to save students time. The hardest part was the rpn, and I thought the point distribution was fair. The lab manual did cover enough detail for starting. 
The examples and ta help really helped me a lot through the process because it took me time to understand. I think more teaching on the concept would of definitely 
helped a lot more.
