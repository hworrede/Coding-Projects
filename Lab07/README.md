1. In this we learned how to use the microcontrollers and pickit more. We got more into learning about FSMs and how they work in coding. We learned more about state machines and 
the common information we needed to understand for the lab. The most important parts were going through all the cases from Setup, cooking, and more. The Oled took me time to fix, 
but eventually worked fine. 
2. I approached the lab not reading the manual first, but instead going to a section where I could ask questions and get a better understanding from them.
 I eventually spent more time on the lab manual and got more understanding of it. The LED functionality had many problems for me because I wasn't able to get to work 
 correctly, and tried all the other solutions to debug it and fix it. The first few function worked well because I followed the manual and was able to much better after. I would have started this lab 
 earlier because I was rushing most that I could towards the end.It hurt a little because I have a lot of other work to do. Other students helped by answering questions about errors
 and common issues we were having. 
 4. Finally I was able to finish everything besides fully getting the LED functionality to work. I spent more than 8 hours on the lab and most of was on the functions and debugging. I liked that 
 the lab taught us more about the Toaster Ovens, but I didn't like the certain problems I was having that caused me to have excessive work. The lab was worthwhile, but took me longer than expected and 
 spent more time on the debugging of it. Point distribution was fair and did not have any problems. The discussion and teachings helped me a lot in class.
